# Trello

This project includes Sass and lot of modern Css features.

Purpose of the project is making practice with Sass-Css.

Layout was created mostly with flexboxes.

Codes are written by me but the project does not belong to me.

This is Jonas Schmedtmann's project which is created for learning purposes.

Really satisfying and instructive project for me.
